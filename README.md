# Café Ember - Coffee Shop Website

This project contains a complete, production-ready coffee shop website built using Tailwind CSS via CDN. It includes four pages with consistent navigation:

- index.html — Home
- about.html — About / Our Story
- menu.html — Menu
- contact.html — Contact

How to run locally
- Open each HTML file directly in your browser (no server required)
- Or host on any static hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

Notes
- All pages use Tailwind utility classes only for styling (no external CSS files).
- Hero sections utilize a background image placeholder format: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1682094506582-6266881e5054?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU5NDkwNzQ3fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 to be replaced with real assets.
- Menu items and content are realistic and ready to customize for your brand.
